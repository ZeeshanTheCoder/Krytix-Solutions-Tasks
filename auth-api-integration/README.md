[https://key-pass-auth.vercel.app/](https://key-pass-auth.vercel.app/)

This is a React-based authentication application that allows users to log in, sign up, and access a protected dashboard. The app includes protected routes, error handling, JWT token management, and a responsive design for desktop and mobile views.

## Features
- **Login & Signup:** Users can sign up with their username, email, and password, or log in using their credentials.
- **Protected Routes:** Access to the dashboard is restricted to logged-in users only.
- **JWT Authentication:** Tokens are stored in localStorage or sessionStorage for maintaining the session.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, with a design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling:** An error boundary component displays a message when something goes wrong in the app.
